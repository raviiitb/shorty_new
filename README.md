## App purpose
It shortens a long url. Visiting this short url will redirect to original url.


## Implementation
I have used the Bitly service to shorten the url.

## UI
On the home page, you can enter a long url in the given box and then click on Get button. It will navigate to a new page where you can see the shortened url of the given url. When you click on the short url, it will open the original url in a new tab.
